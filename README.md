The project is to support a hotel to maintain the basic information related to the hotel. The main aim of this Project is to make a customer easy to go through the hotel and their facilities and a customer can easily book and order their facilities without any hardness. One of the fantastic features of the internet is online hotel booking. In addition to being quick, easy, and handy, booking a hotel online is also incredibly affordable. Nowadays, a lot of hotel providers have websites, which enables consumers to visit these sites and examine the amenities and features each of them offers.
In order to handle the hotel's present manual system for both local and distant customers, the suggested computerized online Hotel Management System is designed to be more practical, well-organized, quick, dependable, and accurate. Any hotel should employ this technique, in my opinion.
The Hotel Management platform developed using technologies such as Express JS, Nodejs for server side, Rest API and ReactJS for client side and mongo dB as the database. This system allows Admins to add, update, and delete Hotel Employees, Foods, Rooms, and Customers can search and order the rooms and foods according to their needs. 
Customer must sign up before using the system if they do not have an account. After successful registration, the user will be able to get the service in the application. After successful login customers will redirect to the home page and they can see the Rooms that are available. They can select Rooms, and those will be added to the cart. And pay for the respective rooms ordered. if a customer wants to have food, they can go through the food section available and they can select the food they like and after selecting the Foods, Food will be delivered to your door.
